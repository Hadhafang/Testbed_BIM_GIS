# Testbed_BIM_GIS
This testbed conatains FME scripts/custom transformers which handles conversion IFC to mesh, conversion between IFC and SGP (Swedish geoprocess) and calculations of building footprint area and height of a building model (IFC). For each script/custom transformer there is a document "Description and usage" that describes the script (in English). Annotations in the scripts are either in Swedish or English.

__Content__:
1.  IfcToMesh
2.  Building footprint area
